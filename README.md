# Impletation 
In the project, the flowers inputed are converted to an array of pairs, that contain the distance
to the flower we try to classify (each distance type creates a diffrent array), and a refrence to the flower itsef.
then we run the Quick select algorithm on the array (by the distance), which with the partitions prevides us with the first k elements, and then we find which type shows up the most and thats the classifier!
